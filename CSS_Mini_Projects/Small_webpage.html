                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                was born on October 15, 1931, in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
                ☛ He served as the 11th President
                of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
                ☛ Kalam earned a degree in
                aeronautical engineering from the
                Madras Institute of Technology and in
                1958 joined the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
                ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                Space Research Organisation, where he
                was project director of the SLV-III, the
                first satellite launch vehicle that was
                both designed and produced in India.
                <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                    “Missile Man.”</strong>
                <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
                was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                ballistic missile, which incorporated
                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                in 1989.
                <br><br> ☛ He also played a
                pivotal organisational, technical,
                and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                <br><br> ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                was scientific adviser to the defense
                minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                <br><br> ☛ His prominent role in
                the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                solidified India as a nuclear power and
                established Kalam as a national hero,
                although the tests caused great concern
                in the international community.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put
                forward a countrywide plan called
                Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                as a road map for transforming India from
                a less-developed to a developed society
                in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                other measures, increasing agricultural
                productivity, emphasizing technology as
                a vehicle for economic growth, and
                widening access to health care and
                education.
                <br><br> ☛ Kalam received <b>7</b>
                honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
                universities. The Government of India
                honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
                    in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
                    in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
                DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
                to the Government.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1997, Kalam received
                India's highest civilian honour, the
                Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
                the scientific research and modernisation
                of defence technology in India.
                <br><br> ☛ In 2013, he was the
                recipient of the Von Braun Award from
                the National Space Society "to recognize
                excellence in the management and leadership
                of a space-related project".
                <br><br> ☛ While delivering a
                lecture at the Indian Institute of
                Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
                <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
                <br><br> ☛ Wheeler Island, a
                national missile test site in Odisha, was
                renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
                2015.
                <br><br> ☛ A prominent road in
                New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
                Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
                in August 2015.
                <br><br> ☛ In February 2018,
                scientists from the Botanical Survey
                of India named a newly found plant
                species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
                honour.
